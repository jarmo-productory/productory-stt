## Key Differences Between Netlify and Render

### Deployment Process

**Netlify**:
- Required a specific plugin (`@netlify/plugin-nextjs`)
- Needed complex redirect rules in `netlify.toml`
- Had compatibility issues with Next.js 15's App Router

**Render**:
- Supports Next.js 15 with App Router out of the box
- Simpler configuration with `render.yaml`
- No need for complex redirect rules

### Configuration

**Netlify**:
- Configuration in `netlify.toml`
- Required specific build settings

**Render**:
- Configuration in `render.yaml`
- Supports standard Next.js build and start commands

### Environment Variables

**Netlify**:
- Set in the Netlify dashboard or in `netlify.toml`

**Render**:
- Set in the Render dashboard
- Support for bulk import of environment variables

### CI/CD

**Netlify**:
- Built-in CI/CD with GitHub integration

**Render**:
- Built-in CI/CD with GitHub integration
- Additional GitHub Actions workflow for more control

## Migration Steps

1. Created `render.yaml` configuration file
2. Updated `next.config.js` to be compatible with Render
3. Created helper scripts for deployment, environment variables, and testing
4. Set up GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
5. Updated documentation

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the application to Render
2. Configure environment variables in the Render dashboard
3. Set up GitHub secrets for CI/CD
4. Test the deployment
5. Update DNS settings to point to the new Render deployment

## Conclusion

The migration from Netlify to Render was necessary due to compatibility issues between Netlify and Next.js 15's App Router. Render provides better native support for Next.js 15 applications and offers a simpler deployment process. The migration process involved creating new configuration files, updating existing ones, and setting up CI/CD pipelines.
